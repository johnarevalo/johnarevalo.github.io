I work with machine learning applications. I'm a PhD student in the [engineering
school](http://ingenieria.unal.edu.co/) at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia
[UNAL](http://www.unal.edu.co/), advised by professor [Fabio
Gonz√°lez](http://dis.unal.edu.co/~fgonza/). Previously, I graduated with a MSc
in Computer Science from UNAL and a BSc in
[Telematics](http://www.udistrital.edu.co/dependencias/tipica.php?id=11) from
the Universidad Distrital. My research interest are focused on representation
learning and multimodality.
